Project license detector - a command line application or a library, written in Go.
It scans the given directory for license files, normalizes and hashes them and outputs
all found fuzzy matches with the list of reference texts.
The returned names follow [SPDX](https://spdx.org/licenses/) standard.

Why? There are no similar projects exist which can be compiled into a native binary without
dependencies and also supports the whole SPDX license database (â‰ˆ400 items).
The implementation is also fast and the API is easy to use.

The license texts are taken directly from [license-list-data](https://github.com/spdx/license-list-data)
repository. The detection algorithm is **not template matching**;
this directly implies that go-license-detector does not provide any legal guarantees.
The intended area of it's usage is data mining.

## Installation

```
go get -v -d gopkg.in/src-d/go-license-detector.v1/...
```

## Contributions

...are welcome, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## License

Apache 2.0, see [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md).

## Algorithm

1. Find files in the root directory which may represent a license. E.g. `LICENSE` or `license.md`.
2. If the file is Markdown or reStructuredText, render to HTML and then convert to plain text. Original HTML files are also converted.
3. Normalize the text according to [SPDX recommendations](https://spdx.org/spdx-license-list/matching-guidelines).
4. Split the text into unigrams and build the weighted bag of words.
5. Calculate [Weighted MinHash](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/36928.pdf).
6. Apply Locality Sensitive Hashing and pick the reference licenses which are close.
7. For each of the candidate, calculate the [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) - `D`.
the corresponding text is the single line with each unigram represented by a single rune (character).
8. Set the similarity as `1 - D / L` where `L` is the number of unigrams in the quieried license.

This pipeline guarantees constant time queries, though requires some initialization to preprocess
the reference licenses.

## Usage

Command line:

```bash
license-detector /path/to/project
```

Library:

```go
import "gopkg.in/src-d/go-license-detector.v1"

func main() {
	licenses, err := ld.InvestigateProjectLicenses("/path/to/project")
}
```

## Regenerate binary data

The SPDX licenses are included into the binary. To update them, run
```
make bindata.go
```
